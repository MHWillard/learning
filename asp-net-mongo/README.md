# ASP.NET Core - Weapon Store

This is a simple project that will, in stages, develop a full-stack website for maintaining an inventory of weapons for an imagined fantasy weapon store website. The long-term goal is to have a React frontend with a .NET backend, a MongoDB, and host it on the cloud.

**WeaponStoreAPI:** Just the API by itself with a Mongo DB installation.

**WeaponStoreReact:** The API with a React frontend for connecting. (in progress)
